    <Description>The Long Range Proving Ground at Cape Canaveral has been constructed as a joint project by the Army, Air Force and Navy.  Our previous location in White Sands was remote, but did not allow for signifcant downrange tests.  Here we fly craft hundreds or thousands of miles over the ocean without risk to life or property.</Description>

    <Description> The Air Force has begun the process of developing a backup ICBM.  This missle can use a more modern design to achieve greater capabilities.  It will also give the contractors on the first ICBM some motivation to deliver.  While having similar requirements, the mandate is for an entirely new design using new engines, guidance and tankage.  This means that a defect in one part will not ground the entire missle deterrent.  A development contract is now available. </Description>

    <Description>With intelligence pointing to a Soviet lead in the race to develop long-range missiles, defense planners have decided a stopgap is needed.  A medium-range missle could be rushed into service using the engines we have developed for ICBMs.  Our allies in Europe can deploy these as a stopgap to maintain strategic balance. A development contract is now available.</Description>

    <Description> The Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee (codename Teapot) was established in October 1953.  The committee recommends that the ICBM program be accelerated and that the payload requirements be reduced to match new miniaturized warheads.  Your ICBM Development funding rate has increased.  </Description>

    <Description> The United States and the Soviet Union have both announced their intention to place articifial satellites into Earth orbit as part of recently announced Geophysical year.  The year, which is actually 18 months long, runs from 1957 to 1958. Your Project Vanguard funding rate has been modestly increased in order to meet this goal. </Description>

    <Description>The Soviet Union has awed the world by placing humanity's first artificial satellite into orbit.  The Sputnik probe lacked any scientific equipment and appears to be an effort to demonstrate Soviet superiority in heavy-lift missle technology. The satellite was launched on a 300-ton R7 ballistic missle. Preisdent Eisenhower dismisses the importance of this achievement, but others worry that the Soviet Union could soon have an uncounterable arsenal in orbit. Swift and succsessful completion of Project Vanguard is now essential to show the world that the United States will not fall behind in missle capabilities.  Project Vanguard has received crash funding and your contract has been cancelled and replaced. Do whatever it takes to get to orbit.</Description>

    <Description>The Soviet Union has rushed to place a satellite into orbit to match the recent scientific achievement of the United States.  Unlike our recent scientific satellite, this had no scientific equipment aboard and appears to be a desperate attempt to save face.  The satellite was launched on a 300-ton R7 ballistic missle.  Some defense officials fret that the Soviet's heavy lift capability is ahead of our own.</Description>

    <Description>The United States has awed the world by placing the first aritifical satellite in orbit. It launched on a small rocket with only peaceful applications. This satellite is our contribution to the International Geophyiscal year and will take unprecedented measurements of Earth and space. Already it has discovered bands of charged particles 1000km above the surface of the Earth.  Initial theories are that this is the solar wind, trapped by Earth's magnetic field.  What else will we discover as we continue to blaze a trail for humanity into the stars?  </Description>

While political leaders put on a brave face, this acheivement is clearly diminished in the eyes of the world by the prior efforts of the Soviet Union.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will take over the exploration of outer space under civilian leadership.  Weapon development will be left to the military.  Missle development is no longer your mandate.  Funding for these contracts will cease January 1, 1960.  </Description>

The objective must be far beyond current capbilities, to give the United States the chance to catch up to Soviet advances in heavy-lift capabilities.

This is a great achievement for humanity and a great victory for the 400,000 of our citizens who contributed to this project.

    <Description> After the incredible achievement of landing on the moon, the space program no longer has the urgency it once did in the eyes of the public.  Budget hawks see the current funding as unsustainable with a war to fund.  Others see such expenditures as outrageous with so much poverty and inequality at home.

    <Description> The Apollo program is over.  The United States government is focusing its efforts elsewhere. The giant rockets that took humans beyond low orbit are unaffordable.  The great visionaries are retiring, knowing their dreams of moon bases and men on Mars will not come to pass.  NASA will have to chart a new course in space exploration.   Long duration stays in orbit, reusable launch vehicles and robotic missions to the planets will occupy the next decades.  Perhaps someday humankind will regain its desire to explore the stars. </Description>
