SpaceRace Change Log

0.11 (??/11/2024)

Features
* Implemented a text and picture based tutorial.  This could expand to a reference manual in future versions.
* Launchpads now recover any nearby craft when a craft is rolled out (usually).

Balance
* Vanguard program funding extended.  It was ending too early.
* Some contract prerequisites adjusted to make the path forward more obvious.

Bug Fixes
* Craft no longer spawn imprecisely.  This was a bug with the mod after all, not the stock code (sorry devs!)
* Preflight saves now save craft in the correct position, so they will not shift on undo.
* Game now saves when the flight scene needs to reload for a launch.
* Fixed the payload in SRBM contract preventing warp.
* Fixed an error in one of the Gemini contracts.
* Contracts completed in simulation should no longer have their funding canceled in the real game.
* Game now checks completed contracts on load to establish past funding.  This should make it easier to reload and fix any funding bugs.
* Events that cancel contracts should now be more enthusiastic about preventing their return.
* The orbital science contracts are no longer dependent on a historical event firing correctly, and should reliably become available after either first satellite contract.
* Launchpads clamps are no longer treated as landing legs in the stage UI.  It looked cool, but was confusing the stage analyzer.
* The space center UI will make an effort to hide the flight inspector.
